1. **What is your proudest software accomplishment? This question is required. This is your chance to wow us. Don't be shy.**
+ My proudest software accomplishment occurred during my internship at Huawei Technologies Canada, where I focused on performance optimization for MindSpore, an open-source deep learning platform. I conducted thorough performance analyses under different usage pressure and successfully optimized two key operators and algorithms. This effort resulted in a significant performance improvement: a 10% increase over TensorFlow and a remarkable 5-fold enhancement over Librosa. This achievement not only showcased my technical skills and analytical capabilities but also contributed to advancing the efficiency and competitiveness of MindSpore's computational framework.

+ Tensor/matrix operators.
+ Time valued compared to TensorFlow and Librosa.
+ random Input, make sure output < error tolerance.
+ Case divided into square-like matrix / longer matrix.
  + Then padding
  + Implement conv2d (2D convolution layer) with multi-threading.
+ Outcome: a 10% increase over TensorFlow and a remarkable 5-fold enhancement over Librosa.
