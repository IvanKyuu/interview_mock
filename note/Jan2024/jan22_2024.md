1. what layer would database management like MySQL, MyBatis will count into the OSI model?
  + The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It is divided into seven layers:

    1. **Physical Layer**
    2. **Data Link Layer**
    3. **Network Layer**
    4. **Transport Layer**
    5. **Session Layer**
    6. **Presentation Layer**
    7. **Application Layer**

    + Database management systems like MySQL and data access frameworks like MyBatis operate at the **Application Layer** of the OSI model. Here's why:

    - **Application Layer (Layer 7):** This layer provides services for an application's specific needs, such as file transfers, email, and database access. MySQL, being a database management system, and MyBatis, a data mapping framework, are used directly by end-user applications to store, retrieve, and manage data. They rely on underlying layers to establish connections (like TCP/IP, which operates at the Transport and Network layers) but are themselves focused on application-specific functionalities like data queries, transaction management, and data modeling.

    + These tools do not directly involve themselves with the functionalities of the lower layers of the OSI model, such as routing, addressing, data transfer protocols, or physical transmission media. They work on the highest level, dealing with the representation and manipulation of data in a way that is meaningful for applications and end-users.

2. I have AI algorithm/operator implementation and data pipeline modules implementation experience in Huawei, how should I address these skills during the interview and what sort of jobs could I find after Huawei?
