## 专业问题
**1.** what layer would database management like MySQL, MyBatis will count into the OSI model?
  + **GPT**: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It is divided into seven layers:

    1. **Physical Layer**
    2. **Data Link Layer**
    3. **Network Layer**
    4. **Transport Layer**
    5. **Session Layer**
    6. **Presentation Layer**
    7. **Application Layer**

    + Database management systems like MySQL and data access frameworks like MyBatis operate at the **Application Layer** of the OSI model. Here's why:

    - **Application Layer (Layer 7):** This layer provides services for an application's specific needs, such as file transfers, email, and database access. MySQL, being a database management system, and MyBatis, a data mapping framework, are used directly by end-user applications to store, retrieve, and manage data. They rely on underlying layers to establish connections (like TCP/IP, which operates at the Transport and Network layers) but are themselves focused on application-specific functionalities like data queries, transaction management, and data modeling.

    + These tools do not directly involve themselves with the functionalities of the lower layers of the OSI model, such as routing, addressing, data transfer protocols, or physical transmission media. They work on the highest level, dealing with the representation and manipulation of data in a way that is meaningful for applications and end-users.


Meredith 建议：
**Application Layer** - I have experience in the Backend development and infrastructure desgins.


**2.** I have AI algorithm/operator implementation and data pipeline modules implementation experience in Huawei, how should I address these skills during the interview and what sort of jobs could I find after Huawei?

+ **GPT**:Your experience with AI algorithm/operator implementation and data pipeline modules, especially in a prominent company like Huawei, is highly valuable and can open doors to a range of career opportunities. Here's how you can address these skills during an interview and the types of jobs you might consider:

  ### Addressing Your Skills in an Interview:

  1. **Concrete Examples:** Provide specific examples of projects you worked on at Huawei. Explain the challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and the outcomes of your work. This can include AI models you developed, optimizations you made, or complex data pipelines you managed.

  2. **Technical Proficiency:** Discuss the technical skills you acquired, such as programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies you used. Be prepared to talk about why you chose certain technologies over others and the advantages they provided.

  3. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Highlight how you approached problem-solving, particularly in developing AI algorithms or managing data pipelines. This can include how you handled big data, optimized algorithms for performance, or ensured data integrity and security.

  4. **Teamwork and Collaboration:** If you worked in a team, discuss your role and how you contributed to the team's success. Mention any cross-departmental collaboration, especially if it required you to communicate complex technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders.

  5. **Impact and Results:** Focus on the impact of your work. How did your contributions improve processes, increase efficiency, or contribute to the success of a project or the company as a whole?

  6. **Continual Learning and Adaptation:** Tech fields evolve rapidly. Talk about how you stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in AI and data management, and how you have adapted to changes in the past.

  ### Types of Jobs You Might Consider:

  1. **Data Scientist/Data Engineer:** With your experience in data pipelines, you could fit well in roles focused on extracting, processing, and analyzing large datasets.

  2. **AI/Machine Learning Engineer:** This role would leverage your experience in AI algorithm development, focusing on creating intelligent systems and models.

  3. **Software Engineer (with a focus on AI/ML):** Many software engineering roles now require an understanding of AI and ML principles, especially in tech-forward companies.

  4. **Research Scientist (AI/ML):** If you have a strong theoretical background, you could work in R&D, contributing to advancements in AI technologies.

  5. **Product Manager (Technical):** If you're inclined towards the management side, a technical product manager role in AI or data products could be a good fit, especially if you enjoy working at the intersection of tech and business.

  6. **Consultant (AI/ML, Data Solutions):** Use your expertise to advise various businesses on implementing AI solutions and managing data effectively.

  7. **Start-up Opportunities:** Given the rise of AI and data-centric start-ups, your experience could be invaluable in a smaller, more agile company environment.

  Remember, each of these roles will have specific requirements, so tailor your application and interview preparation to align with the job description. Additionally, networking and professional platforms like LinkedIn can help you connect with potential employers and stay informed about industry trends and job openings.

[394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/)

```python

## Walk Through
+ Example 3: `2[abc]3[cd]ef`
  | step | `string s` leftover | count | `current`          | stack             |
  | ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
  | 1    | `2[abc]3[cd]ef`     | 0     | `''`               | $\emptyset$       |
  | 2    | `]3[cd]ef`          | 2     | `'abc'`            | pop `2, ''`       |
  | 3    | `3[cd]ef`           | 2     | `abcabc`           | `2, ''`           |
  | 4    | `cd]ef`             | 3     | `''`               | `3, 'abcabc'`     |
  | 5    | `]ef`               | 3     | `'cd'`             | pop `3, 'abcabc'` |
  | 6    | `ef`                | 3     | `'cdcdcd'`         | `3, 'abcabc'`     |
  | 1    | `ef`                | 3     | `'abcabccdcdcd'`   | $\emptyset$       |
  | 1    | ``                  | 3     | `'abcabccdcdcdef'` | $\emptyset$       |

## Logic
+ **Notice** that the encoding in [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/) is slightly different than the standard [run-length encoding (RLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding). In RLE, even when the pattern has only one representation, it will still has a leading 1, but in 394, it has not.
+ That warms us about when we should use the stack -- only when the number accurs. Whenever, we see the form $\# [char]$, then we could push it into the stack. Otherwise, we just need to concat all the left strings.

# 遇到的问题
+ 一开始以为是RLE 花了好久然后bug....
+ 还是得想清楚啥时候得用`stack` 啥时候不用。
